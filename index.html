                    <h2>Principles</h2>
<p class="text-left"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin" style="color:red"></span>&nbsp Build &quotlean&quot software using Agile principles which runs your business. By lean we mean it does just what its supposed to do and no more, it doesnt try to confuse you with a plethora of options, does not need giga bytes of installed files, is a breeze to maintain and customize and once installed requires little or no intervention from your staff.</p>
<p class="text-left"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin" style="color:violet"></span>&nbsp We believe in doing things right the first time. There's a lot of hype around IT right now. Companies spend a lot on developing software - which after completion many times DOES NOT meet their actual requirements and has to be scrapped or it&#39;s so painful to use that it has to be &quot;re-done&quot; 
after evaluating your users feedback...<br>
When you engage with us - you get to review working software for your idea every week and if you decide that its not going &quot;according to plan&quot; we stop right there and you dont even have to pay us. Not only that we prototype and wireframe your ideas and get your approval even before we start the development.</p>
<p class="text-left"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin" style="color:green"></span>&nbsp Once we take up an assignment we are committed to it. Our leadership takes personal interest in your project. Our responsibility includes development of software, testing, installation, training, hand over and after sales support. In other words a turn key solution.</p>
<p class="text-left"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin" style="color:yellow"></span>&nbsp We believe - Your success is our success</p>
<p class="text-left"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin" style="color:orange"></span>&nbsp Transparent and straight forward business practices. Sick of all that bureaucracy - we run lean and there's none of that here</p>
<p class="text-left"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin" style="color:blue"></span>&nbsp Take decisions in the best interests of your business and NOT for promoting any particular technology.
We&#39;re not here for selling software licenses, promoting our technology or anything of that sort. Our job is to build the best solution for your business problem using the best technology available be it open source or proprietary.</p>

                    <h2>How we work</h2>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> We collaborate with the stakeholders, understand their expectations and put it all into a SRS (software requirements document). This normally takes anywhere from a day for a simple project to a month for really complex projects.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> Once all the stakeholders have signed off on the SRS we come up with mockups for every unique workflow, for complex projects we take this a step ahead and create prototypes which look identical to the final software but with dummy hard coded data. This step can take anywhere from a day to 2 weeks.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> Once we have signed off on the mockups we provide you with a SOW (statement of work) which calls out the scope of work, identifies the people who would be working on the software, the time lines which include the key feature milestone dates , go-Live dates and the Service Level Agreements (SLA). This step can take anywhere from two days to a week.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> Once you sign off on the Statement of work (SOW) we assign a single point of contact (SPOC) for the project who would be responsible for the execution of the project.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> The SPOC introduces you to the team in a project kick-off meeting</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> We follow SCRUM or Waterfall which are the industry standards for software development world wide. In accordance the SPOC will schedule weekly meetings which would cover project updates and  demonstration of the features completed in the current week via screen sharing. At the end of the weekly meeting you would be emailed the URL for accessing the demoed software remotely and you can pass on the link to your colleagues thus giving you a chance to provide us your feedback early.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> We progress with the development of your software and we sign off on every milestone reached until we reach a  feature complete.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> Our team gives you time to complete your  &quot;user acceptance testing&quot; (UAT) cycles to ensure that the software has  no major defects, if there are any we fix them as you report them on our online defect tracking tool. This stage can take a week to 20 days.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> Once you are satisfied that the software has no defects our team provides you with technical assistance and documentation for deployment and going live.</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-2x pull-left" style="color:green"></span> We continue to support your software after you go live, adding features  or making changes which you feel will help your business.</p>
